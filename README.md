# Nursing-Homes-and-COVID
I want to remove this project outright, but the word document has high-quality writing that prevents me from doing so. As of 5/12/2021, I've been on a purging frenzy of repositories that do not meet my standards.

This project may be revisited to reproduce the results made from the 'mess of Rscripts' in RMarkdown. The Ckrenzer of May 2021 would have done things very differently from the Ckrenzer of November 2020.

## Future Goals
How do I plan to simplify this project? Well, I didn't know about the I() function for linear models when this was first written, so I have a bagillion throw-away variables. I want an uncluttered global environment and for all of my data to be in one table. A more difficult problem is recreating the output in the correct order in a new RMarkdown document. I aim for all the code to fit into one RMarkdown. In fact, the whole paper may be transferred to RMarkdown. Finally, the subfolders are tedious to navigate through, so I will remove them eventually.

If all goes according to plan, there will be a clean repository with an Rmarkdown containing the code and (perhaps) the writing of the Word document, the Word document, a csv file containing all the project's data, and the usual GitHub files.
