# Nursing-Homes-and-COVID

This project models the death rate due to the coronavirus in mid-October, 2020.

This project used to be a complete mess, and many of the results were invalidated because of some rookie mistakes. I revised the paper, models, and code, and the final product became a third shorter than the original (and more accurate)!

To make reproducibility of the results more permanent, the data was compiled into a csv file, so--although I initially scraped all this data myself--the implementation no longer scrapes different documents.

The intro and conclusions are the most entertaining parts, if you don't want to see a play-by-play of each problem encountered while assembling the model. The two most important variables included in this project were the mask and nursing home variables, respectively.

This is a heavily edited version of my undergraduate econometrics project. My professor wanted us to be thorough in our investigation, and maybe you do too!
